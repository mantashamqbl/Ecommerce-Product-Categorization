# Ecommerce-Product-Categorization

Problem Statement
In the rapidly evolving world of eCommerce, accurate product categorization is crucial for ensuring seamless customer experiences, reducing search friction, and increasing product discoverability. However, the sheer volume of diverse products poses a significant challenge. Current classification systems struggle to handle ambiguities, unconventional naming conventions, and multi-language data. ​

Objective
​This project focuses on creating accurate and efficient solutions for eCommerce product categorization. ​

Approach to solve the problem
1. Analyze the Dataset: Explore the provided dataset to identify key features, missing data, and ambiguities.

2. Visualize the Data: Generate meaningful visualizations to uncover data patterns and correlations, considering the text-based nature of the dataset.

3. Preprocess the Data: Clean and transform the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

4. Feature Engineering/Text to Features: Convert raw product data (text descriptions, specifications) into informative features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

5. Address Class Imbalance: Detect and address class imbalance in the product category feature using sampling techniques or class weights.

6. Develop Machine Learning/Deep Learning Models - Multi-class text classifier: Design and train predictive models, considering both machine learning and deep learning algorithms for product categorization.

7. Evaluate Model Accuracy and Other Metrics: Measure model performance using evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.

8. Fine-Tune Models: Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters and selecting the most relevant features.

9. Predict on Test Data: Evaluate the final model on the test dataset to validate its performance.
